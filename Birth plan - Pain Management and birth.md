# Birth plan - Pain Management and birth procedure

## Common practice

- Membrane Rupture
  - Usually done to induce labor or to speedup the dilation of the cervix.
  - Pose a risk of cord prolapse ( The umbilical cord could slip down around or below the baby's head.)
  - Requirement: This should only be done after the cervix has started to dilate and the baby's head is engaged in the pelvis.
  
- Continuous fetal monitor vs. Intermitent monitoring (chose in the birth plan)
  - Continous fetal monitor
    - Requires that the mother to be connected to a machine and may reduce mobility
    - Offer the advantage for the nursing staff to monitor the heart beat and contraction remotely and follow the progression.
  - Intermitent monitoring
    - Less invasive
    - The monitoring is done by the nursing staff on regular basis.

- While under induce or augmented with oxytocin.
  - Reported: It's harder because the contraction is stronger and the break won't be completely painless compare natural.
  - Requirement: Before oxytocin can be given, the cervix must be 3Â cm dilated.
